Group Discussion

A group discussion is a method of evaluating a person's skills and abilities in communication and collaboration. It involves a group of participants who share their views on a given topic or situation.

There are different types of group discussions, such as:

- Factual GD: The topic is based on facts and data that can be verified.
- Opinion Based GD: The topic is based on personal opinions and preferences that can be debated.
- Case Study Based GD: The topic is based on a real or hypothetical scenario that requires analysis and problem-solving.
- Abstract GD: The topic is based on an abstract concept or idea that can have multiple interpretations.

The purpose of a group discussion is to:

- Assess if you can work well with others in a team.
- Evaluate your communication skills, such as clarity, fluency, and coherence.
- Test your spontaneity and creativity in generating ideas and arguments.
- Measure your diction and pronunciation, such as vocabulary, grammar, and accent.
- Observe your body language, such as eye contact, gestures, and posture.

Some of the ethics for a group discussion are:

- Raise your hand if you have a valid point to make.
- Do not interrupt anyone who is speaking.
- When you get a chance to speak, introduce yourself by saying "I am ___".
